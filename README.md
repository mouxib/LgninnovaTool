LginnovaTool is an open source project developed in C++ within Visual Studio Preview 2022. It is a free version designed to extract information from all iPhone devices using the Libimobile device library. This project is an educational tool for novice developers, providing a structured and easy-to-understand codebase.

# 📌 Features and Functionality

✅ Extract device information (serial number, iOS version, mode, battery status, etc.)
✅ Use the Libimobiledevice library to communicate with iPhones
✅ Easy-to-use interface
✅ Fix some system-specific bugs using the 'Repair iDevice' button
# 💡 Development and Learning Opportunities
**This tool does not override any security features (such as iCloud lock or mobile device management). Instead, the program is designed to:**
🔹 Support novice developers in understanding how to interact with iOS devices
🔹 Provide a simple and organized codebase for easy learning
🔹 Enable developers to extend and enhance the tool with additional functionality

# ⚠️ Important Notes
🔹 This program was developed entirely by our team and is a small part of a larger native tool.
